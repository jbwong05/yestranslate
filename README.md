# yestranslate

## Description
Small browser extension that ensures web pages can be translated.

## Inspiration
As a general education requirement, my college requires us to take a foreign language. One of my spanish classes uses an online textbook that uses the `notranslate` class in order to stop Google translate from being able to translate the webpage. This simple extension removes the use of the `notranlate` class allowing web pages to once again be able to be translated by Google translate or another browser extension.
