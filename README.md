# yestranslate

## Description
Small Chrome extension that ensures web pages can be translated with Google translate. Support for other browsers such as Firefox has not been added as other browsers do not have Google translate built in to automatically translate web pages.

## Inspiration
As a general education requirement, my college requires us to take a foreign language. One of my spanish classes uses an online textbook that uses the `notranslate` class in order to stop Google translate from being able to translate the webpage. This simple extension removes the use of the `notranlate` class allowing web pages to once again be able to be translated by Google translate.
